# LCD Custom Character Editor
 I made this simple web app to aid developers in drawing out special character designs for Arduino LCD Screens.<br>
 To run, simply download and open the .html file with your browser.

 Fun Fact: There are ~1.1 trillion unique possible designs on the 5x8 binary pixel grid!

### <em>Version 2 Update</em>
 <ul>
  <li>Added two color schemes that LCD screens typically use for more realistic designing</li>
  <li>Fixed matrix to 5x8 dimentions</li>
  <li>Squished window freezing bug</li>
  <li>Added buttons at the bottom for non-keyboarded platform support</li>
 </ul>
